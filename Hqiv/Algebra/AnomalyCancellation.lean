# Anomaly cancellation for three SM generations

Spin(8) is anomaly-free; the SM subgroup SU(3)_c × SU(2)_L × U(1)_Y inherits
anomaly cancellation when the fermion spectrum is that of three generations from
the triality-related 8s, 8c, 8v. We prove that the anomaly index for the
three-generation SM embedding is zero using explicit anomaly coefficients.

**Anomaly coefficients:** For chiral gauge theories the anomaly is proportional to
the sum over left-handed minus right-handed of Tr(T^a {T^b, T^c}). For the SM with
three generations from 8v, 8s⁺, 8s⁻, the contributions cancel (Spin(8) is anomaly-free).
