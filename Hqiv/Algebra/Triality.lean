# Triality automorphism of Spin(8)

Spin(8) admits an outer automorphism of order 3 (triality) that permutes the three
8-dimensional representations: the vector 8v and the two spinor representations 8s⁺, 8s⁻
(D₄ Dynkin diagram: the three outer nodes are permuted by the cyclic symmetry).
Applying triality to one fermion generation in 8s yields exactly three generations
with identical G₂ quantum numbers.
