This module derives the effective Schrödinger equation as the
Euler–Lagrange equation of an extension of the HQIV action in the
low-energy continuum limit of the null lattice. The same variational
principle that already gives modified Maxwell and GR now yields a
non-relativistic quantum-mechanical description. The derivation is
formulated so that it is fully general for any atom or isotope via
the nuclear charge `Z : ℕ` and reduced mass `μ : ℝ`.

/-- Extended HQIV Lagrangian for non-relativistic quantum mechanics.

The underlying idea is that, in the low-energy sector where the time-angle
is slowly varying and the metric is close to Minkowski, the action acquires
an extra scalar-field contribution whose Euler–Lagrange equation is the
time-dependent Schrödinger equation.

In this skeleton, we package the dependence on the field configuration
`ψ`, nuclear charge `Z`, and reduced mass `μ` into a scalar functional
`hqivQMLagrangian` together with an explicit *Euler–Lagrange equation*
predicate below. The detailed continuum integral over space and time is
left implicit, consistent with the O-Maxwell action style in `Action`. -/

The field `ψ` is a map from time `t : ℝ` to spatial wavefunctions; the

we use the reduced Planck constant `hbar_SI` from `Forces` as the normalisation. -/

General spectrum comment:

Once Mathlib has robust spectral theory for the Laplacian on ℝ³
and the associated spherical-harmonic / associated-Laguerre basis,
this definition will be promoted to a theorem stating that the
eigenvalues of `hqivHamiltonian Z μ` are exactly `expectedEnergy n Z μ`.

## Derivation roadmap

1. **Laplacian wiring:** Replace the placeholder `laplacian` definition
   by the genuine spatial Laplacian on `Wavefunction`, constructed from
   the HQIV metric in `HQVMetric` and the null-lattice continuum limit.
2. **Action functional:** Refine `hqivQMLagrangian` so that it is an
   explicit spacetime functional whose variation reproduces the
   Schrödinger residual `i ħ ∂ₜ ψ − H ψ` in the same way that
   `action_O_Maxwell` yields the modified Maxwell equations.
3. **Hydrogenic spectrum:** Once Mathlib exposes the necessary
   spherical-harmonic and associated-Laguerre machinery, upgrade
   `groundStateIsEigenpair` and connect `expectedEnergy` to the full
   discrete spectrum of `hqivHamiltonian Z μ`.
4. **Back-reaction and HQIV corrections:** After the leading-order
   Schrödinger sector is fully formalised, incorporate horizon and
   curvature-imprint corrections as controlled perturbations of the
   effective Hamiltonian, keeping the same Action-based origin.
