# Observer-centric linear response (lapse sector) — not a replay of GR perturbation theory

The goal here is **not** to reconstruct the standard pipeline (Bardeen potentials, synchronous vs
Newtonian gauge, `Φ`/`Ψ`, matter transfer functions, etc.). HQIV is **observer-centric**: the
informational-energy route fixes the ADM lapse in comoving gauge (`HQVM_lapse` in `HQVMetric`), and
many steps that assume a global foliation or translation-invariant background are **deliberately
out of scope** until they are re-derived from the same axiom base.

What we **do** formalize is the **foundational** first-order response of that lapse to small changes
in the arguments that already appear in the axioms: `Φ`, `φ`, coordinate time `t`, and — when φ is
identified with the temperature ladder — `Θ` via `phi_of_T`. That is “close” to textbook
perturbation language only in the narrow sense of **linearized lapse / clock rate**; it is **not**
claimed to match the full GR perturbation spectrum.

Concretely: from `N = 1 + Φ + φ t` and real analyticity (`analyticOnNhd_HQVM_lapseTuple` in
`HQVMetricAnalytic`) we get the unique first-order piece `δN = δΦ + φ δt + t δφ`, an explicit
quadratic remainder in `(δφ, δt)`, and exact increments for `phi_of_T` (`phi_of_shell_eq_phi_of_T`
bridges discrete shells to the continuous `Θ` picture).

Collective **plasma** bookkeeping (lapse × schematic current, uniform proxy coordinates, flat-φ link
to the O-Maxwell source) lives in `Hqiv.Physics.SchematicPlasmaCurrent` (`linearisedScalarPerturbation`,
`emergentMaxwell_plasma_uniform_t_flat_phi`).

**Uncertainty as driver (no extra axioms):** the same energy–time scale `τ = ħ/ΔE` used for resonance
width in `Hqiv.Physics.SpinStatistics` (`resonance_lifetime`, MeV units) is mirrored here in SI via
`hbar_SI` from `Forces` as `energyTimeResolutionScale`. That fixes a **minimal time resolution** at a
chosen energy increment `ΔE`. Separately, `ObserverChart` matches `Schrodinger.Position` so the spatial
**domain** of perturbations is the same ℝ³ chart the QM skeleton already uses; refinement to shells
or balls is then geometric, not axiomatic. Lapse response to ladder temperature drift is packaged in
`linearizedLapse_from_Theta` using `deriv phi_of_T` from the existing `phi_of_T` definition.

### Homogeneous background vs lapse perturbations (CLASS-oriented bookkeeping)

Volume-averaged or patchwise codes typically hold a **background** `(Φ_bg, φ_bg, t)` and add small
increments `(δΦ, δφ, δt)`. For the HQVM homogeneous slice `Φ_bg = 0`, `φ_bg = H`,
`HQVM_lapse_homogeneous_limit` gives `N_bg = 1 + H t`. The **exact** nonlinear remainder in the lapse
increment is the single bilinear term `δφ * δt` already isolated in `HQVM_lapse_increment_eq`; the
first-order piece is `linearizedHQVM_lapse`. This does **not** assert equivalence with CLASS’s full
Boltzmann/gauge system — only the lapse algebra implied by `HQVM_lapse`.
-/

/-- Same increment identity as `HQVM_lapse_increment_eq`, specialized to `Φ = 0` (homogeneous Newtonian
potential) and background expansion rate `φ = H`, written with `δΦ` as the first argument so it
matches “perturbed Φ” notation directly. -/

### Energy–time resolution and observer spatial chart

We do **not** posit a new Heisenberg inequality as an axiom. We **define** the usual
energy–time resolution scale `τ = ħ/ΔE` (SI joules for `ΔE`, seconds for `τ` up to the
convention baked into `hbar_SI`). Positivity is pure algebra once `ΔE > 0`.

The **spatial domain** is fixed to the same `Fin 3 → ℝ` chart already used for wavefunctions
(`Position` in `Hqiv.QuantumMechanics.Schrodinger`). Open balls in that chart are the natural sets on which to state
later PDE-localized perturbations when the Laplacian placeholder is upgraded.
