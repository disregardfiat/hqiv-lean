# HQVM Minkowski limit alongside the flat 1+1 Lorentz substrate

`HQVMetric` packages the ADM lapse `N = 1 + Φ + φ t`, the time-time metric coefficient
`g_tt = -N²`, and the narrative link between φ (from `AuxiliaryField`) and **horizon phase**
via `timeAngle φ t = φ * t` (period `2π` in the formal lemmas there).

`AuxFieldRapidityNullBridge` packages **special-relativistic** 1+1 data: `minkowskiMetric11`,
`boostMatrix11 η`, and **invariance** of the pairing `minkowskiInner11` under boosts.

## What this file makes explicit

1. **Vanishing `(Φ, φ)` ⇒ `N = 1` and `g_tt = -1`:** the HQVM slice matches the usual Minkowski
   time-time normalization in that limit (`HQVM_lapse_Minkowski`, `HQVM_geometry_Minkowski` are
   already in `HQVMetric`; we restate convenient one-line corollaries).
2. **Conceptual separation:** `timeAngle` is a **cumulative slice phase** tied to φ and `t` in the
   HQVM story; **rapidity** `η` parametrizes **flat** boosts in `AuxFieldRapidityNullBridge`. We do
   **not** assert an identification `timeAngle ↔ η` (different groups / different kinematics).

## Formal gap spelled out (checklist)

### Three independent formal layers today

1. **Discrete null bookkeeping** (`Hqiv.Geometry.OctonionicLightCone` and bridges such as
   `SphericalHarmonicsBridge`): shell index `m`, `available_modes m`, `latticeSimplexCount m`, etc.
   This is **combinatorial** counting tied to the HQIV light-cone axiom. Lean does **not** yet
   equip that data with a subset of `ℝ²` or with an action of the rapidity group.

2. **HQVM lapse / auxiliary φ** (`HQVMetric`, `AuxiliaryField`): real parameters `Φ`, `φ`, time
   `t`, lapse `N = 1 + Φ + φ t`, and `timeAngle φ t = φ * t`. This fixes **how φ enters the
   time-time factor** in the chosen ADM slicing. There is **no** theorem connecting `φ` or
   `timeAngle` to `boostMatrix11` or to a Lorentz transformation on `Fin 2 → ℝ`.

3. **Flat 1+1 Lorentz geometry** (`AuxFieldRapidityNullBridge`): `minkowskiMetric11`,
   `boostMatrix11 η`, and proved **bilinear** invariance of `minkowskiInner11` under `Λ(η) *ᵥ ·`.
   Rapidity parametrizes **linear automorphisms of** `Fin 2 → ℝ`, not the shell ladder.

`OnFlatHQVMSubstrate` only yields `N = 1` and `g_tt = -1` when `Φ = φ = 0`. That aligns the
**normalization** of the time-time block with Minkowski time; it is **not** a chart or a boost law.

### What a “join frames via φ / null structure” theorem would require

**(A) Carrier and chart.** A type `S` (or a family over shells) and a map `χ : S → (Fin 2 → ℝ)`
interpreting discrete increments or phases as **tangent-like** vectors in 1+1 Minkowski space,
so that “null on the lattice” can mean `minkowskiSq11 (χ s) = 0` when that is the intended model.

**(B) Rapidity action on `S`.** A rule `β : ℝ → S → S` (rapidity acts on the discrete carrier)
such that the diagram with `χ` and `boostMatrix11` commutes, e.g.
`χ (β η s) = boostMatrix11 η *ᵥ χ s` for all `η` and `s` (or a stated weakening). Until `S`, `χ`,
and `β` are **defined**, equivariance under `boostMatrix11` is not a proposition about
`latticeSimplexCount` or `phi_of_shell`.

**(C) Transformation rule for φ.** In `HQVM_lapse`, `φ` is a **slice parameter**, not a field on
`Fin 2 → ℝ`. Any law `φ ↦ φ'_η` (scalar pullback, phase recoloring, etc.) is **extra packaging**.
Standard special relativity would use a **Lorentz scalar** law only after φ is **defined** as a
function (or section) on the spacetime modeled by the chart—not from `timeAngle φ t` alone.

**(D) Target statement (shape only).** A closure would tie (A)–(C) to a quantity built from HQIV
data (phase, weight, lapse expression) and assert invariance or equivariance under the chosen
`(χ, β, φ ↦ φ'_η)`.

None of (A)–(D) is currently proved from the imports below; the following placeholders only **name**
the shape of that future glue.

**Continuum chart (flat `l²` on four indices):** `Hqiv.Geometry.ContinuumSpacetimeChart` equips
`Fin 4` with `EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 4)` and Mathlib `gradient` / coordinate divergence — the
Euclidean backbone for φ and vector fields before Lorentzian metric factors or discrete lattice
embeddings.

**1+1 into `Fin 4`:** `Hqiv.Geometry.SpacetimeMinkowski11Embed4` embeds 1+1 Minkowski coordinates into
`Fin 4 → ℝ`, proves agreement of the quadratic form with `minkowskiSq11` on the slice, and shows the
constant forward-null `(1,1)` direction maps to a null vector in the ambient `minkowskiSq4` signature.

## Signature alignment (informative)

Both `HQVM_g_tt` (with `N = 1`) and `minkowskiMetric11` use the **mostly-plus spatial** convention
for the spatial part in their respective contexts; the time-time block is **negative** in either
formalism when `N > 0` and `g_tt = -N²`. A full dimensional match (3+1 HQVM vs 1+1 SR) is not stated
as a theorem — only the **normalization** `g_tt = -1` on the vanishing slice.
