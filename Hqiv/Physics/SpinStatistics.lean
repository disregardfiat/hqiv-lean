## Spin–statistics from triality and null-lattice causality

This module sets up a **clean logical chain** for the spin–statistics link in
an HQIV-style setting, with **no sorrys**:

1. We introduce an abstract type of one-particle lattice modes and a
   `SpinClass` (integer vs half-integer) encoding the SO(8) → SO(3,1)
   projection.
2. We package **exchange phases**, a **spacelike-separation** relation, and
   the data needed to talk about spin and locality in a `SpinStatisticsData`
   structure.
3. We formulate *axioms* that abstractly encode:
   * triality-style bilinears (two spinor modes → bosonic observable),
   * null-lattice causality (local commutativity at spacelike separation),
   * and an identification between 2π-rotation phases and exchange phases.
4. From these axioms we derive, in Lean, the **spin–statistics rule**:
   half-integer–spin modes have exchange phase −1 under exchange, integer-spin
   modes have exchange phase +1.

This gives a precise target: to realise the axioms using the existing HQIV
light-cone + monogamy + Spin(8) machinery, and then plug into the general
lemma proved here.

/-- Axioms encoding triality, causality, and the link between spin (2π phase)
and exchange phase for a given `SpinStatisticsData` bundle.

These are deliberately abstract; the goal for HQIV is to *realise* them from:

* the Spin(8)/so(8) structure obtained from counting over O,
* the null-lattice / monogamy geometry (HQVMetric, `Now`),
* and the way triality maps pairs of spinor modes into bosonic observables. -/

  This is the step where the *representation-theoretic* phase (from Spin(3,1))
  is tied to the exchange phase for identical modes. In a full HQIV

  underlying Spin(8) / triality data. -/

/-- **Spin–statistics from triality and null-lattice causality (HQIV version).**

This `Prop` bundles the desired theorem as a single statement, in the same
spirit as `YangMills_SM_GR_Unification_statement`. It says that there exists
a description of one-particle lattice modes such that:

1. (**Spin classes from Spin(8)**)
   Modes fall into two spin classes `integer` and `halfInteger` derived from
   the Spin(8) / so(8) structure and its triality, with:
   * `halfInteger` modes picking up a phase −1 under 2π rotation,
   * `integer` modes picking up +1 under 2π rotation.

2. (**Null-lattice causality / monogamy**)
   There is a spacelike-separation relation compatible with the HQIV null
   lattice such that:
   * local bosonic observables (built from vector / integer-spin reps) commute
     at spacelike separation,
   * these observables can be expressed as triality-induced bilinears of the
     underlying one-particle modes.

3. (**Spin–statistics conclusion**)
   For *identical* modes, exchange phases are fixed purely by the above:
   * half-integer–spin modes anticommute (exchange phase −1),
   * integer–spin modes commute (exchange phase +1).

The details of “triality-induced bilinears” and “locality” are kept abstract
here; the goal for future work is to realise this statement with the concrete
Spin(8) data from the generator stack and the discrete null lattice.

For any given `SpinStatisticsData` bundle, the axioms suffice to derive the
spin–statistics sign rule: half-integer–spin modes have exchange phase −1,
integer–spin modes have exchange phase +1.

This is the internal chain of logic; HQIV's task is to *realise* these axioms
using the light-cone + monogamy + Spin(8) machinery. -/

## Energy-time uncertainty for resonances

This section links an overlap energy scale `ΔE` to a resonance lifetime via the
standard uncertainty relation. It lives here because the fermionic lattice rules
constrain the admissible overlap energies, and those energies then control the
strong-decay timescale.

**SI twin:** `Hqiv.energyTimeResolutionScale` in `HQVMPerturbations` uses the same `τ = ħ/ΔE` form
with `hbar_SI` from `Forces` for observer-centric time-resolution bookkeeping on the lapse /
perturbation side (no new axiom).
