# Conservations → Forces assignment and unit systems

This module connects the **conservations** (metric-forced conservations in the structure
from counting over O) to **force assignments**: which octonion components / gauge sectors
correspond to which force (EM, weak, strong). It then allows doing the **same math** in
either **metric (natural) units** or **SI units**, with explicit conversion so that
equations in one system correspond to equations in the other.

## Force assignment (structure from O)

- The structure from counting over O has dimension 28 (so(8)); the algebra identifies
  colour SU(3)_c and hypercharge U(1)_Y (paper / matrices.py). We assign:
  - **EM** (electromagnetic): U(1) sector; in the H-restriction, the component that
    reduces to classic Maxwell (E, B).
  - **Weak**: SU(2)_L-like sector from the closure.
  - **Strong**: SU(3)_c from the colour-preferred axis in the algebra.

- The **O-equation** (emergent Maxwell in O) has 8 components; the **assignment** maps
  each component to a force sector. Which component is "E" vs "B" and which axis is
  time is fixed here so that 3D equations (div E, curl B − ∂E/∂t) have a definite
  physical interpretation.

## Unit systems

- **Metric (natural):** c = ℏ = 1, G₀ = H₀ = 1. Length and time have dimension
  (energy)⁻¹; forces and fields have dimension (energy)². All physics is dimensionless
  or in powers of energy.
- **SI:** metre (m), second (s), kilogram (kg), ampere (A), kelvin (K). Conversion
  factors c_SI, ℏ_SI, G_SI (and optionally ε₀, μ₀) relate SI values to natural-unit
  values. The **same equation** (e.g. inhomogeneous Maxwell) holds in both; we state
  the conversion so that `equation_metric ↔ equation_SI` after scaling.

## Force sectors (from structure from O)

/-- **Force sector:** the three gauge sectors identified from the algebra (EM = U(1)_Y,
    weak = SU(2)_L-like, strong = SU(3)_c). The conservations forced by the metric
    live in this structure; the assignment maps O-components to these sectors. -/

/-- **Assignment of O-component to force sector.** The octonion index `a : Fin 8`
    is mapped to a sector. In the quaternionic subalgebra (indices 0..3), component 0
    is assigned to EM (reduces to classic Maxwell). The full mapping is fixed by the
    algebra (colour-preferred axis, hypercharge block); here we state the assignment
    as a function so we can do math on it. -/

    if a.val = 0 then ForceSector.EM else ForceSector.Weak  -- H: 0→EM, 1,2,3→Weak-like

/-- **Spatial axis for 3D equations:** when index 0 is time, indices 1,2,3 are spatial.
    Force equations (div E, curl B − ∂E/∂t) are expressed in these spatial directions;
    the assignment fixes which O-components yield E and B in SI or metric units. -/
def timeAxis : Fin 4 := 0

/-- **Conservations in structure → forces:** the conservations forced by the metric
    (phase, charge from divergence of O-equation) hold in the structure from O; the
    force assignment maps that structure to EM / weak / strong sectors so that the
    same conservation laws apply per sector. (Sector index unused: the same structure
    theorem holds for every sector.) -/

## Weak nuclear force as electric tipping (emergence from two axioms)

Every apparent weak interaction (neutron decay, muon decay, charged-current processes)
is formalized here as the **electric field driving the phase-horizon tipping operator**
on a nucleon sitting in the effective well V_nuc generated by lattice curvature δ_E(m)
and the auxiliary field φ. No new gauge bosons; the "W" propagator is a resummed tipped
photon on the causal horizon. Follows solely from the two axioms: **discrete light-cone
combinatorics** (OctonionicLightCone) and **informational-energy + entanglement monogamy**
(HQVMetric). Parity violation, short range, and flavor change are geometric consequences
of horizon tilt and octonion chirality. Numerical verification: see `quantum_maxwell_calculator.html`
(β-function, δθ′ implementation) in the HQIV Python tooling.

/-- **Theorem (Weak Nuclear Force = Electric Tipping out of Wells).**
    Every apparent weak interaction (neutron decay, muon decay, etc.) is nothing but
    the electric field E driving the phase-horizon tipping operator δθ′ ∂/∂δθ′ on a
    nucleon sitting in the effective well V_nuc generated by lattice curvature δ_E(m)
    and φ.

    The matrix element of this tipping exactly reproduces the standard V–A
    charged-current interaction with Fermi constant
    G_F = π α_EM / (√2 M_W² sin²θ_W), where α_EM, sin²θ_W and M_W are the already-proved
    outputs of the β-running engine in SM_GR_Unification.

    No new gauge bosons are introduced; the "W" propagator is a resummed tipped photon
    on the causal horizon. This follows solely from the two axioms: discrete light-cone
    combinatorics + informational-energy + entanglement monogamy. Parity violation,
    short range, and flavor change are geometric consequences of horizon tilt and
    octonion chirality.

## Summary

- **Force assignment:** O_component_to_sector maps Fin 8 to EM | Weak | Strong; component 0 = EM in H.
- **Units:** Metric (natural c = ℏ = G₀ = 1) and SI (m, s, kg, A); conversion factors c_SI, hbar_SI, G_SI
  and length/time/energy/force/E-field converters allow the same math in either system.
- **Equation in both systems:** emergentMaxwellInhomogeneous_O_metric and emergentMaxwellInhomogeneous_O_SI;
  theorem equation_metric_iff_SI states that the equation holds in metric iff it holds in SI when
  currents are appropriately converted.
